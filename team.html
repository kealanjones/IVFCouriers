                        Simon manages the business, operations and logistics side of the team. He brings with him a wide range of business management experience in regional as well as international airport operations. His career background in freight-forwarding, air cargo, logistics and assistance, coupled with his experience and expertise in both trade body negotiation and the organization and transportation of dangerous goods cargo led to the creation of IVF Couriers with Annare in 2012. Whilst fertility samples are by no means ‘dangerous’ goods, the detailed processes and safe guards involved are of paramount importance in transit.British in origin, with a childhood spent in Kenya, Simon is bi-lingual English and French and resides in France where his family is being raised in a multi-cultural community. Creative, pragmatic, generous and resourceful, his significant experience in cross-cultural relations and diplomacy ensures that IVF Couriers keeps it’s thinking cap on with new ideas and innovations to improve service and delivery.Along with Annare, Kate and the entire courier team, Simon personally organizes and hand carries shipments over, under and around the world to ensure that promises are kept.

                        Kate’s background as a Nursing Facilitator and her experience in innovative nursing care is invaluable as we continue to seek to better understand how we can assist both clinics and labs as well as those undergoing fertility treatments. During her time as Office Manager for a large OB/Gyn Practice, her responsibilities for staffing and patient scheduling meant that she was solving patient issues on daily basis. As the physicians in the practice were regularly the first port of call for many patients with fertility issues, Kate understands the diagnostics, logistics as well as the emotions surrounding these complicated times.Raised and educated in Ireland, Kate moved to Chicago, where she started working at a large Ambulatory Surgery, and hasn’t left the medical field since. Kate’s clinical experience has involved Critical Care, the Emergency room, Surgery and most recently as medical assistant to a trauma surgeon. Hopefully we won’t face any such urgent situations, but it’s good to know that Kate is as cool under pressure as your precious cargo!
